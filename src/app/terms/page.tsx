      <h1 className="mb-2 text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900">Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="mb-8 text-gray-500">Last updated: June 20, 2026</p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        These terms govern your use of Cipher (&quot;the app&quot;). By creating an account or using the app, you
        agree to these terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">The service</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cipher lets you build and run automated workflows, optionally connecting third-party accounts (such as
        Google) so workflow nodes can act on your behalf within the scopes you explicitly authorize.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Your responsibilities</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You are responsible for the workflows you create and the accounts you connect to them. You must only connect
        accounts you own or are authorized to access, and you must comply with the terms of any third-party service
        (such as Google) you connect through Cipher.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Connected accounts</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you connect a third-party account, Cipher acts only within the scopes you approve during that
        provider&apos;s consent flow. You can disconnect a connected account at any time, which immediately revokes
        Cipher&apos;s stored access for that account.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">No warranty</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The app is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for actions taken by
        workflows you configure, including any automated actions performed on connected third-party accounts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Changes</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes
        acceptance of the updated terms.
      </p>
