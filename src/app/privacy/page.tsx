      <p className="mb-6">
        Cipher (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;the app&quot;) is a workflow automation tool. This policy explains what
        data we access, why, and how it is handled.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Data we access</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you connect a third-party account (such as Google) to a Cipher workflow, we request only the minimum
        scopes needed for the feature you enable. For example, the Gmail Search node requests read-only access to
        your Gmail messages (<code className="rounded bg-gray-100 px-1">gmail.readonly</code>) and your account
        email address, solely to run the searches you explicitly configure in your own workflows.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not read, store, or process your email content except to execute the specific search you request at
        the moment you run a workflow. Search results are used to generate the workflow output you see; we do not
        use this data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to running your workflow.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How we store data</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        OAuth access and refresh tokens are encrypted at rest. Tokens are used only to make authorized API calls on
        your behalf when you run a workflow that needs them. You can disconnect a connected account at any time from
        the node&apos;s settings, which deletes the stored tokens immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mb-2 mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Data sharing</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data retrieved from connected accounts is processed
        only to fulfil the workflow you configured and is not shared outside of that workflow&apos;s execution.
      </p>
